We study Wiedijk's toy model of Mizar's soft type system, by formalizing
it in Coq.

The basic components are:
1. The syntactic encoding of soft types, and the inductive definition of
   well-typedness for soft types.
2. An encoding of first-order logic using locally nameless variables.
3. A translation of soft-types into first-order logic.
4. The results concerning correctness.

I'm basically doing something like test-driven coding in Coq, where the
`Example` environment is used for tests.

## First-order logic encodings

A lot of the inspiration for encoding natural deduction comes from
Daniel Schepler's 
[coq-sequent-calculus](https://github.com/dschepler/coq-sequent-calculus).
For locally nameless encoding and first-order logic considerations, I
consulted (among the random books in my bookcase):
